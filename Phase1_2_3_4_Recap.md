🧩 Project Setup Recap

**1. Created project folder structure** — with clean modular layout: core/, services/, and ui/.

2. **Set up FastAPI backend** — services/api/app/main.py as the app entrypoint.

3. **Added routing structure** — routes/health.py and routes/recipes.py for API endpoints.

4. **Implemented /health endpoint** — verified server runs using uvicorn main:app.

5. **Created core/config.py** — centralized environment and OpenAI config using pydantic_settings.

6. **Fixed version compatibility** — upgraded to pydantic v2 and added pydantic-settings.

7. **Validated environment variables** — defined Settings model (OpenAI key, model, etc.).

8. **Built recipe agent skeleton** — recipe_agent.py with placeholder logic for recipe generation.

9. **Tested POST endpoint** — /recipes/generate with Preference model via Postman.

10. **Verified end-to-end flow** — API returns "Recipe generation coming soon!" successfully

🧠 1. core/ — The Intelligence Layer (Brains of the App)

Purpose: Holds all reusable business and AI logic.
Includes:

config.py → environment setup, model configs, API keys.

agent/ → AI reasoning modules (prompt logic, chaining, orchestration).

utils/ → helper utilities like logging, parsing, embedding functions.

✅ Why: Keeps your AI logic isolated from APIs and UI — so the same logic can later power a web app, mobile app, or CLI tool without rewriting anything.

⚙️ 2. services/ — The Backend Service Layer (APIs & Orchestration)

Purpose: Exposes APIs and orchestrates calls between user, agents, and databases.
Includes:

api/app/main.py → FastAPI app entrypoint.

routes/ → individual route handlers.

schemas/ → request/response models.

✅ Why: Cleanly separates “how” requests are served (FastAPI) from “what” logic runs (agents).
Makes your app microservice-friendly and ready for deployment via Docker, AWS Lambda, etc.

🎨 3. ui/ — The Presentation Layer (User Interface)

Purpose: Streamlit or Gradio interface for end users to interact visually.
Includes:

Simple web UI to input diet, cuisine, ingredients, and get recipes.

✅ Why: Keeps frontend fully decoupled from backend — you can iterate UI independently or even build multiple UIs (e.g., web + mobile) powered by the same API.

🧩 Overall Architecture Benefits
Principle	Benefit
Separation of Concerns	Each layer does one thing well (logic, service, or UI).
Reusability	Core logic can be reused across different projects or APIs.
Scalability	Easy to expand with new features like memory, RAG, or multi-agent flow.
Maintainability	Cleaner code, easier debugging and testing.

Phase 1: Folder structure
Phase 2: Fast API - basic setup and testing
Phase 3: Recipe Geneartor and actual Fast API end points and connecting OpenAI. Tested via swagger
Phase 4: Add streamlit app
